# Optimizing Delivery Routes Using K-Means Clustering and TSP

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing delivery routes across selected Indian states using machine learning techniques. We use K-Means clustering to segment delivery locations and solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) within each cluster to minimize the total distance and runtime.

## Key Techniques
- Data Cleaning and Outlier Removal
- K-Means Clustering (using Elbow Method for optimal clusters)
- Traveling Salesman Problem (Nearest Neighbor Heuristic)
- Distance and Runtime Trade-off Analysis
- Visualizations (Cluster vs. Time, Cluster vs. Distance)
